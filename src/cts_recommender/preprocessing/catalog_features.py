Catalog Feature Processing for WhatsOn Movie Catalog

This module provides feature processing for movie catalog representation,
separate from the ML training features used for audience ratings regression.

Key differences from ML_feature_processing.py:
- catalog_features.py: Process features for catalog representation (WhatsOn movies)
- ML_feature_processing.py: Process features for model training (historical programming data)

While they share transformation logic (via feature_transformations.py),
they serve different purposes in the system architecture.
